## What are Projects?

[Codédex Projects](https://www.codedex.io/projects) is a catalog of fun, beginner-friendly, and real-world programming tutorials available to developers all over the world. Our goal is to create a mountain of top-notch coding content on the web, from Python to Web Development, VR/AR to Machine Learning.

Here are some examples of Codédex Projects:

## What stage of development are we in right now?

Now that the MVP is out, our goal for Codédex Projects is to invite awesome content creators from the community to author one or two project tutorials since maintaining a resource of this type at-scale is only possible if it's open-sourced. That means we need your help, whether it's contributing, reviewing, or evangelizing!
